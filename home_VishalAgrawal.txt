HEADLINE:
Accomplished Plant Breeder | Commercial Hybrid Developer | Cross-Regional Breeding Experience

INTRODUCTION:
Welcome! I'm Vishal Kumar Agrawal, Ph.D.

I am an accomplished Plant Breeder with 12 years of experience, specializing in hybrid development, marker-assisted selection (MAS), and multi-location breeding programs. Having served as breeder-of-record for six commercial watermelon hybrids launched across India (2020-2023), I have demonstrated expertise in combining traditional breeding methodologies with modern molecular breeding tools to develop climate-resilient, market-driven varieties.

My career journey encompasses CSIR-NET(JRF) qualified Ph.D. research in quantitative genetics at BHU, followed by progressive roles across leading seed companies including East-West Seed, ICAR-IIVR, Namdhari Seeds, and Monsanto (now Bayer). At East-West Seed (2019-2025), I led watermelon breeding programs with global impact, collaborating extensively with international teams in Thailand, Philippines, East Africa, and Latin America to advance region-specific hybrids. I also worked closely with pre-breeding and molecular breeding teams to support the development of genomic selection protocols for watermelon improvement.

My passion lies in bridging the gap between cutting-edge breeding science and practical farmer solutions, ensuring that innovative varieties reach those who need them most. I am driven by the mission to enhance global food security through the development of high-yielding, stress-tolerant crops that can thrive in changing climatic conditions.
